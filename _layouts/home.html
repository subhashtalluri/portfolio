                With experience in engineering and data science, I am uniquely positioned as a data scientist for aerospace, manufacturing
                and industrial IoT domain. I bring cross functional expertise at the intersection of mechanical engineering, computer science, big data, statistics and business to provide quality and scalable solutions. Some of my interests include: 
                    
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Predictive maintenance of aircraft engines, mechanical & industrial systems </li>
                  <li>Sensor, Image & video analytics for infrastructure monitoring </li>
                  <li>Bridging the gap between engineering simulations and data driven modeling</li>
                  <li>Building model agnostic explanations for black box ML methods in engineering </li>
                </ul>

                <b><span style="color:brown"><font size="4">Profile At-A-Glance</font></span></b> <br>
                I hold a master's degree (MS) in computer science from <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</a> and a master of engineering (M Eng) degree in aerospace science from <a href="http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies.</a> Before graduate studies I completed bachelor's in mechanical engineering from JNT University, India.  
                <br>
                <br>
                In the past I have worked with <a href="http://www.pwc.ca/">Pratt & Whitney Canada</a> as a materials & structures specialist for turbine engines involved in design, stress analysis, thermal analysis, dynamic analysis, impact analysis, fracture mechanics, fatigue life evaluation, MRB activities, structural testing & root cause investigations. I have a solid understanding of product lifecycle management in a manufacturing setting from cradle to grave.
