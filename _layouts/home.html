                I lead the technical AI/ML domain of the telecom industry business unit at Amazon Web Services. Help build scalable, secure, and compliant AI/ML solutions via cloud-optimized architectures on AWS. Help customers design and develop machine learning solutions that leverage the AI/ML stack on AWS via POCs and MVPs, evangelize AWS AI design patterns and best practices for the telecom industry and provides technical subject matter expertise to the business development team in the development of market penetration strategies to enable broad use of AWS within enterprise customers.

                <b><span style="color:brown"><font size="4">Career Aspiration</font></span></b> <br>
                Data science is transforming every industry at a rapid pace. While there is a huge potential for machine learning, it is equally challenging to fully integrate data science into business. Over a career spanning 10+ years, I had the opportunity to work with customers, system integrators and cloud providers. Most companies trying to achieve digital transformation have often resulted in wasted resources and efforts due to lack of strategic vision. In part, this is because the leadership and higher/middle management are not fully aware of the practicality of data science for improving their business outcomes. There is clearly a lack of data scientists in the decision-making authority to steer the companies in the right direction. I choose to fill that gap using my cross functional expertise at the intersection of engineering, computer science, machine learning and business to provide quality and scalable solutions.

                <b><span style="color:brown"><font size="4">Profile At-A-Glance</font></span></b> <br>
                I'm currently pursuing MBA from <a href="https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois - Gies College of Business</a> in global strategy. I hold a master's degree (MS) in computer science from <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</a> and a master of engineering (M Eng) degree in aerospace science from <a href="http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies.</a> Before graduate studies I completed bachelor's in mechanical engineering from JNT University, India.  
                <br>
                <br>  
                Over a 5 year career in data science, I developed myself into full stack data scientist handling the elements of data engineering, data visualization, machine learning & operations, big data and cloud computing. I aimed to be a specilist in two of these areas (machine learning, cloud computing) and a generalist in the other three. This allowed me to handle the complete data lifecycle and help build production grade systems. From identifying the right problem, translating the problem in terms of data, getting the data, building the pipelines, analysing data, building models, presenting findings, putting models in production and maintaining them, I aspire to handle it all. <br><br>  
                
                In the past I have worked with <a href="http://www.pwc.ca/">Pratt & Whitney Canada</a> as a materials & structures specialist for turbine engines involved in design, stress analysis, thermal analysis, dynamic analysis, impact analysis, fracture mechanics, fatigue life evaluation, MRB activities, structural testing & root cause investigations. I have a solid understanding of product lifecycle management in a manufacturing setting from cradle to grave.
