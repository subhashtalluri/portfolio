    <b>Predicting Borrower Risk using Lending Clubâ€™s loan data Augmented with Alternative Data</b><br>
    The current US system of lending is not very good at assessing the risk of borrowers. It relies on a singular value known as a credit score which is biased against people who have had one late payment or people with no credit history. To challenge this approach, publicly available data is used to augument <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">Lending Club's</a> data to predict borrower's risk.  </li>

    <b>Instacart product recommendations invoked from a web application</b><br>
    The web application uses python as middleware to fetch data from postgreSQL database to drive online ML predictions through a javascript/bootstrap powered front end.</li>
