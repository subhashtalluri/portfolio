    <b>Fracture Mechanics - Linear & Non-Linear crack growth analysis</b><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Expertise in fracture mechanics approach to structural reliability.</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Presence of defects such as cracks or crack-like flaws are inherent to any component. Whether it grows to an unacceptable size during it's life is the essence of life prediction using fracture mechanics. This is accomplished by estimating the initial crack size and the time for the crack to grow from its initial size to a final critical size. It requires crack tip stress intensity factors to quantify stable growth or unstable fracture under elastic or near elastic loading conditions.</li>
