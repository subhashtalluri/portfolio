      <li>
    <b>Engineering Design Simulations & Tests - Structures, Dynamics, Impact</b><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Expertise in component and system level simulations, structural tests and root cause investigations.</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Worked on thermal analysis, structural analysis, rotor containment analysis, tip clearance, structural tests, bird strike analysis, ice-ingestion analysis, bolted joint analysis, creep analysis, stiffness analysis, windmill and maneuver conditons.    </li>
        </ul>

    <b>Fatigue Life Evaluation</b><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Expertise in determining component life under fatigue loading.</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Versed in understanding fatigue, general characteristics, S-N curves, design for fatigue, Rain flow cycle counting, constant life curves - goodman diagram, miners rule, engineering & true stress/strains, hysteresis loop, cyclic stress strain curve, LCF/HCF interaction, strain life prediction, notch fatigue factors, Neuver relationship and Juvinall method.</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
    
    <li>
    <b>Fracture Mechanics - Linear & Non-Linear crack growth analysis</b><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Expertise in fracture mechanics approach to structural reliability.</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Presence of defects such as cracks or crack-like flaws are inherent to any component. Whether it grows to an unacceptable size during it's life is the essence of life prediction using fracture mechanics. This is accomplished by estimating the initial crack size and the time for the crack to grow from its initial size to a final critical size. It requires crack tip stress intensity factors to quantify stable growth or unstable fracture under elastic or near elastic loading conditions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
    <b>Material Review Board (MRB) activities</b><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Expertise in reading part drawings, understanding the manufacturing process, reviewing repair/rework schemes and evaluating engineering deviations for their acceptability.</span>
        <ul>
              <li>Deviations in hardware against engineering definition can originate during manufacturing of parts, assembly or during any manufacturing process - raw material, rough machining, final machining, surface treatments or externally sourced operations. Considering the part's end use, 'Fit and Form' is analyzed for it's effect on surrounding hardware and the higher assembly. It is also analyzed for commercial, certification and safety issues such as impact on TBO (Time Before Overhaul), LCF life and damage tolerance.  </li>
             
          </ul>
            
      </li>
       <li>
    <b>Design for Additive Manufacturing</b><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Expertise in design optimization (shape & topology) for metal additive manufacturing.</span>
        <ul>
              <li>Current design practices try to reduce manufacturing costs and not always straight forward given design constraints. Together with many different loading types, it is often necessary to perform many iterations manually to get a working design and they don't lend themselves well to fast turnaround or low weight designs. I have performed topology optimization which rendered truely organic free form shapes that can only be 3D printed. Once the loading is well understood, topology optimization was able to provide a functional design with very low weight in a fraction of the time. </li>
